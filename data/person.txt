yashjaipuriya not many times buddy it happens all the time agree to the taxation point but as i said not against the practice it has use cases

yashjaipuriya those additional shares are not free the value is adjusted you are paying coz those additional shares are coming from the intrinsic value of your present shares

thepricetrader1 agreed

yashjaipuriya no i am not infact i am not against the practice i am against the name bonus that makes it sound like a freebie this is misleading to the new investors

rishabhkhatri i missed mrf 8 years ago when it was at 9k thinking the same its 10x from there but sure liquidity helps at times so i am not against the practice but the name “ bonus” is misleading

nikhilp88915039 yes at times liquidity could help i am not against the practice but against the name “bonus” its misleading to new investors

theanuragnag there is absolutely no impact buddy because u earn profit not on number of shares but on amount invested which remains the same bonus or no bonus

“bonus shares” is the most misleading term in stock market it increases quantity of shares amp decreases value of each share proportionately ex if you had 2 shares worth 100 each you will now have 4 shares worth 50 each assuming its 11 bonus how is it a bonus stocks

had a wonderful and refreshing meeting with dhanush he has unleashed the power of communicating unconventionally with the masses

the swift and firm action of the chief minister is commendable the heroic actions by the 3 deceased staff members also needs recognition

my sympathies go out to the families of patients and the three staff members that have lost their lives in an attempt to rescuing patients

doctors and attendants allegedly leaving patients to die unattended in these circumstances is unbelievable and deserves condemnation

every doctor and staff member should be primarily concerned with the well being of patients with a responsibility for caring treatment

all hospitals primary mandate should be to save the lives of patients and should not be driven by making extraordinary profits

the recent events in the hospital in kolkata resulting in the deaths of several patients is deplorable and inexcusable

we should provide the motivation and the opportunity for these successful people to make their rightful contribution with due recognition

many of them want to give back to india their expertise and knowledge doctors scientists and technologists are our greatest ambassadors

i visited the new hospital at ucla and feel proud to see many young indian doctors in significant positions

political differences and vested interests should never be allowed to stand in the way of indias economic progress

it would be a question of national pride for every indian to rebuild the past glory and reestablish the countrys economic leadership

we should never let the extraordinary momentum achieved or the global visibility we had diminish

forces thought they would knock us down but instead they created a city of heroes

we should all find our private space to recall the events of 26112008

as i go home at the end of this momentous week i will fondly remember all the good wishes and kind sentiments expressed by so many

i am very pleased and committed to achieve a smooth and seamless transition to my successor cyrus is a very good choice for the job

i have been with the tata group since 1962 the years have been exciting and interesting

enjoyed meeting the students of uh hotel school impressed by their intelligence and great spirit i wish all of them all the very best
