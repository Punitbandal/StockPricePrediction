yashjaipuriya not many times buddy it happens all the time agree to the taxation point but as i said not against the practice it has use cases
yashjaipuriya those additional shares are not free the value is adjusted you are paying coz those additional shares are coming from the intrinsic value of your present shares
thepricetrader1 agreed
yashjaipuriya no i am not infact i am not against the practice i am against the name bonus that makes it sound like a freebie this is misleading to the new investors
rishabhkhatri i missed mrf 8 years ago when it was at 9k thinking the same its 10x from there but sure liquidity helps at times so i am not against the practice but the name “ bonus” is misleading
nikhilp88915039 yes at times liquidity could help i am not against the practice but against the name “bonus” its misleading to new investors
theanuragnag there is absolutely no impact buddy because u earn profit not on number of shares but on amount invested which remains the same bonus or no bonus
“bonus shares” is the most misleading term in stock market it increases quantity of shares amp decreases value of each share proportionately ex if you had 2 shares worth 100 each you will now have 4 shares worth 50 each assuming its 11 bonus how is it a bonus stocks
