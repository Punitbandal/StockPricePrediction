had a wonderful and refreshing meeting with dhanush he has unleashed the power of communicating unconventionally with the masses
the swift and firm action of the chief minister is commendable the heroic actions by the 3 deceased staff members also needs recognition
my sympathies go out to the families of patients and the three staff members that have lost their lives in an attempt to rescuing patients
doctors and attendants allegedly leaving patients to die unattended in these circumstances is unbelievable and deserves condemnation
every doctor and staff member should be primarily concerned with the well being of patients with a responsibility for caring treatment
all hospitals primary mandate should be to save the lives of patients and should not be driven by making extraordinary profits
the recent events in the hospital in kolkata resulting in the deaths of several patients is deplorable and inexcusable
we should provide the motivation and the opportunity for these successful people to make their rightful contribution with due recognition
many of them want to give back to india their expertise and knowledge doctors scientists and technologists are our greatest ambassadors
i visited the new hospital at ucla and feel proud to see many young indian doctors in significant positions
political differences and vested interests should never be allowed to stand in the way of indias economic progress
it would be a question of national pride for every indian to rebuild the past glory and reestablish the countrys economic leadership
we should never let the extraordinary momentum achieved or the global visibility we had diminish
forces thought they would knock us down but instead they created a city of heroes
we should all find our private space to recall the events of 26112008
as i go home at the end of this momentous week i will fondly remember all the good wishes and kind sentiments expressed by so many
i am very pleased and committed to achieve a smooth and seamless transition to my successor cyrus is a very good choice for the job
i have been with the tata group since 1962 the years have been exciting and interesting
